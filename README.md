# RUST Stereo

Starting here with rust and OpenCV to capture stereo camera images and transform them into a PointCloud.

This Projects is a follow up of my Master Thesis from 2024.
Although here I will focus on a rust implementation and not C++ for ROS2.

The goal might be to have a working VSLAM and Routing solution for a wheeled vehicle or also a flying one.
If I even get to such a point...
